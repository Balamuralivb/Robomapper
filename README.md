# Robomapper
This project is an attempt to explore ROS2 and particularly robomapping by implementing 2-D SLAM Algorithm.

#Prerequisites
-ROS2 Humble
-RViz2
-Gazebo
-TurtleBot3
-Slam-Toolbox
-Navigation2
-nav2_bringup

#Problems
-I made a launch file that automates the startup of complete SLAM simulation using TurtleBot3 in gazebo and also visualizes mapping in RViz, but when I run the command to launch the file I get unexpected errors such and "missing file/directory".
